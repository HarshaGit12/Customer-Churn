# Customer Churn - Telecom
## Project Context:
### The cost of acquiring a new customer is far more than that for retaining the existing one
### In this project, we try to predict using ML Algorithms, the association of the customers as to whether or not they will leave the company using various attributes related to the telecom services
## Project Overview:
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis is done and Feature Importance is also shown
### 2. Three Classification Algorithms - Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost Classifier are used to model the data
### 3. Out of the 3 Classification models, Random Forest gave better AU-ROC score of 0.978, hence this model is chosen
### 4. Code is also written to take input from user and give prediction as to whether the customer will churn or not using the Random Forest model

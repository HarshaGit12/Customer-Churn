# Customer Churn - Telecom
## Project Context:
### With the rapid development of telecommunication industry, the service providers are inclined more towards expansion of the subscriber base. 
### The cost of acquiring a new customer is far more than that for retaining the existing one. 
### Therefore, it is imperative for the telecom industries to use advanced analytics to understand consumer behavior and in-turn predict the association of the customers as whether or not they will leave the company.
## Project Overview:
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis is done and Feature Importance is also shown
### 2. Three Classification Algorithms - Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost Classifier are used to model the data
### 3. Out of the 3 Classification models, Random Forest gives better Au-ROC score of 0.978, hence this model is chosen
